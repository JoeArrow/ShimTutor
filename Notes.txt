Add Fakes Assembly:

    In Solution Explorer, expand the test project's reference list. 
    If you are working in Visual Basic, you must choose Show All Files in order to see the reference list.

    Select the reference to the assembly in which the interface (for example IStockFeed) is defined. 
    On the shortcut menu of this reference, choose Add Fakes Assembly.

    Rebuild the solution.
